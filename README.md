What is the CanSat competition?

Hosted by the American Astronautical Society, the CanSat Competition is an annual student design-build-launch competition for space-related topics, with this year's mission being focused on simulating controlled atmospheric reentry of a delicate payload. 
The payload- an egg- is launched in a rocket up to 725 meters before ejecting itself and descending to ground level inside a "CanSat"  probe using an aerobrake and a parachute. 
Live telemetry is sent to a ground station to confirm descent stability while telemetry is also stored onboard the probe during flight.
